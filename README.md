**Define data structures (struct, mapping) to store voter details and candidates.**
**Implement functions for voting, adding candidates, and tallying votes.**
**Add require statements to handle eligibility checks (e.g., ensuring users can only vote once).**
**Test by adding candidates and simulating votes.**
**Compile and deploy the contract.**
